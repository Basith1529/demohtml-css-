	 <h2> Cricket Summary </h2>
	 <p> Cricket is <mark>a team sport involving a bat and ball played between two teams of eleven players each</mark>. The objective is to score more runs (points) than the opposing team. A match is divided into innings during which one team bats, two batter at a time, and the other team bowls.</p>
	 <hr>
	 <h2> Short Paragraph Of Cricket </h2>
	 <p> Competitive cricket is essentially a bat and ball sport. It is played by two teams on an oval and involves batting, fielding and bowling. There are 11 players a side and a game can last anywhere from several hours to several days. Cricket can be played both socially and competitively, by males and females of all ages.</p>

	 <h2> History </h2>
	 <p>Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement. Others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[3] In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[4] The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".</p>

	 <h2> Law and Gameplay </h2>
	 <img src="images/hl1.png" style="width:200px; height:300px;" align="right"/>
	 <p>In cricket, the rules of the game are codified in The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws"), which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744, and since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[70</p>
	 <h3>playing area </h3>
	 <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image of cricket pitch and creases) between two teams of eleven players each.[71] The field is usually circular or oval in shape, and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line, or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.

In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[73] The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</p>

	 <h2> Match Structure and Closure </h2>
	 <p> Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings.[76] "Innings" is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[76] In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batters.[77][78] When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.[76] During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting their ability to run; in this case, the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs,[79] though this does not apply in international cricket.[80] The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.</p>

	 <h3> Innings </h3>
	 <p> The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "At the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in".[76] In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress.
	     <br><br>
		 An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:</p>
	<ul>
	   <li>the batting team's <span style="color:green;">captain may declare the innings closed</span>, even though some of the captain's players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because the captain believes that their team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings.</li>
	   <li> the set number of <span style="color:green;">overs</span> (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled.</li>
	   <li> the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time </li>
	   <li> in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.</li>
	 </ul> 
	 <h3> Overs </h3>
	 <p> The Laws state that, throughout an innings,<span style="color:green;"> "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls"</span>.[84] The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at <span style="color:green;">"square leg"</span> now stands behind the wicket at the nonstriker's end and vice versa.</p>
